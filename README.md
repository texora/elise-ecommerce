[Elise](https://onurs-ecommerce-site.netlify.app/) is an e-commerce website built with NextJS and ChakraUI. It is currently under construction.

Elise will be a modern and user-friendly platform for buying and selling products online. It will feature a clean and intuitive interface, fast and secure payment processing, and a wide range of products to choose from. 

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop and improve Elise!
